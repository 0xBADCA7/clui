2016-10-13 - Version 0.5.0

[+] Added mouse move and mouse button release support:
    Now all windows can be dragged and resized with mouse
[+] Added constants for dragging events - new type DragType
[+] Added new type of Event MouseClick: it generates if a user does mouse
    button down and mouse release at the same coordinates. In this case a
    control recieves 3 events: mouse down, mouse release, and mouse click
[+] Main loop moved to separate source file
[+] Added test for color parsing functions

[*] Logger moved to separate source file and it is global object now
[*] Windows do not have their own interface - all objects are derived from the
    same interface. It simplifies things like container objects
[*] Library initialization is made simpler: only one call is required, there
    is no need to create composer, theme manager etc manually - everything is
    created inside library initialization
[*] Because composer, theme manager and some other objects are hidden now then
    a set of methods are just global library functions:
        Event processing functions like Stop(), PutEvent() etc
        Theme manager related functions like SysColor(), SysObject() etc
[*] All functions to create new objects New* are renamed to Create* functions.
    CreateWindow now is for internal use only: it creates a window but it does
    not do anything else, so the window is not displayed and a user cannot
    interact with it. Use AddWindow function instead of CreateWindows.
[*] All text output is colorized by default. So, Multicolor property is
    removed. If you want to draw text as is then use DrawRaw* functions.
[*] Now all drawing function uses the current canvas colors, so all color
    function arguments of all drawing functions are removed. Use global
    functions SetTextColor and SetBackColor to change colors before drawing.
    PopAttributes and PushAttributes may come handy to save/restore canvas
    attributes between drawing calls
[*] Renamed a few constants to get rid of negative constructions:
    DoNotScale -> Fixed
    DoNotChange -> KeepValue

[-] The first argument view of all Create* functions is removed as obsolete.
    Now library does not require to set parent Window. It is sufficient to set
    only control's parent. It made some functions more complex but it seems
    easier for developer
